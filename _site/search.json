Wellness parameters in free-ranging eastern box turtles with a high prevalence of myiasis on Cape Cod, MA, were documented to identify epidemiologic trends or associations with several health parameters. There were 109 samples collected from 59 individual box turtles over the course of 4 mon. Six turtles died over the course of this study. Fly larvae infestations varied in severity and were observed in the cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue (n \\(= 18\\); 30.5%). Animals with myiasis had fewer plastron abnormalities than those without (P \\(= 0.034\\)), and all turtles found in bogs had evidence of fly larvae infections (P \\(&lt; 0.0001\\)). Individuals with myiasis also had lower body condition index (P \\(= 0.014\\)), lower total white blood cells (P \\(= 0.031\\)), lower PCV (P \\(&lt; 0.0001\\)), lower total solids (P &lt; 0.0001), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P \\(&lt; 0.0001\\)), lower calcium (P \\(= 0.018\\)), and lower phosphorus (P \\(= 0.017\\)). Three turtles tested positive for terrapene herpesvirus 1, but presence was not associated with myiasis. Heavy metal analysis revealed no significant differences between turtles with and without myiasis.

Two groups of participants with different levels of prior experience working with Gopher Frogs assigned scores to a set of images presented to them for each condition.

We found high ICC values for inter-rater agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement to the benchmark standard indicating either excellent or good reliability for all five conditions and for all raters when grouped together. These findings support the reliability and validity of the proposed developmental abnormality scoring system. Gopher Frog headstarting facilities can implement this scoring system to assist in tracking the frequency and severity of abnormalities observed in future headstarting efforts.

    "text": "I am a Biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the Columbia Environmental Research Center in Columbia, Missouri. As part of the Fisheries and Invasive Species Program, my research focuses on understanding the behavior of invasive carp species/developing tools to limit their spread throughout the Mississippi River basin.\nI received a M.S. in Integrative Conservation & Sustainability from the University of Georgia’s Odum School of Ecology in 2023. My thesis looked at improving head-starting practices and developing a new soft release method to protect threatened gopher frog populations in South Carolina. Before that, I graduated with a B.S. in Biology from the University of South Carolina, Aiken in 2019.\nI’m interested in conservation ecology, data science, science communication, invasive species, amphibian ecology, ecotoxicology, and restoration ecology. I work a lot with R and GIS and have no trouble teaching myself new software. My latest pursuits are Quarto and LaTeX for writing protocols, manuscripts, and storing code.\nOutside of work, I enjoy going for walks with my wife, spending time with my daughter, herping, camping, playing adult-league soccer, and board games with friends."

    "text": "Our daughter has been born! She was born on August 3rd and she and my wife are doing really well a week later. We have had so many people show up in support of us including in-laws and the family we are living with right now in Missouri. From groceries, to meals, to gift cards for food — my step-father-in-law even changed the oil in one of our cars to help out.\nWe’re trying to cherish this time right now just the three of us. I have some time off work over the next year (up to 12 weeks), so I’ll be taking a large chunk of that time up front.\nJuly 29 2025\nA lot has unfolded since I wrote an update. My wife is due any day now. She’s been a trooper for her first time as a mother, having gone over her due date by 6 days now. Hang in there sweetie!\nI still have my job, praise God. He has really taken care of our every need. A couple months ago we moved in with a family from our church and my wife resigned from her job because we both felt like that’s what God was telling us in preparation for the baby coming.\nIt’s been a summer of transition between the short distance move from Rocheport, MO to Harrisburg, MO (still in the Columbia, MO area). We are a little more cramped now, but God knew what we needed between saving money on rent and having closer connection with our community.\nMarch 8 2025\nMy wife is expecting in late July and we are very excited to be first-time parents!\nSince moving to Missouri, our church family has been so generous to us, helping meet our every need—like helping us move from our apartment to new rental home and gifting us an AirBnB for no reason other than just needing a weekend escape.\nWith the recent federal Reduction in Force (RIF) memorandum in effect, my wife and I are expecting that I will lose my job in the coming weeks/months."

    "text": "Conservation plans to protect Gopher Frog (Lithobates capito) populations commonly include headstarting to improve recruitment to the juvenile stage. Headstarting is being used across multiple federal, state, non-government, and academic organizations to augment and/or reintroduce Gopher Frog populations. In 2021, 99% of the 332 Gopher Frogs headstarted during the egg and larval stage at the University of Georgia Savannah River Ecology Laboratory in South Carolina displayed morphological abnormalities at metamorphosis. These included skin, eye, gill, and jaw abnormalities plus edema and redness of the skin. Skin abnormalities were the most prevalent, affecting 99.1% of frogs. Using a quantitative scoring system, we scored a subset of 92 frogs at metamorphosis and between 8-–26 d after metamorphosis; all except eye abnormalities either partially or fully recovered. Based on photographs of early-stage tadpoles taken for a separate experiment, 79% of tadpoles had eye abnormalities as early as 16 d post-hatch. Except for gills and bloating, we found that models including mesocosm as a predictor had greater Akaike Information Criterion weights than those that did not have mesocosm as a predictor, suggesting the cause may be related to mesocosm-specific conditions. Since 2017, abnormalities in either Gopher Frogs or federally listed Dusky Gopher Frogs (L. sevosus) have been reported from at least six other headstarting facilities. It is unclear whether these abnormalities are related to captive conditions or are occurring in wild populations as well. Collection of additional data on rearing conditions will aid in determining relationships between headstarting environments and health of metamorphs.\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Zotero \n\n@article{McFall_etal_HerpetolConservBiol_2023,\n    Author = {Adam J.
