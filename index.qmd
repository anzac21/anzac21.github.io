I am a Biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey at the [Columbia Environmental Research Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/columbia-environmental-research-center) in Columbia, Missouri. As part of the [Fisheries and Invasive Species Program](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/columbia-environmental-research-center/science/science-topics/invasive-species-ecology), my research focuses on understanding the behavior of invasive carp species/developing tools to limit their spread throughout the Mississippi River basin.

I received a M.S. in Integrative Conservation & Sustainability from the University of Georgia's Odum School of Ecology in 2023. My thesis looked at improving head-starting practices and developing a new soft release method to protect [threatened gopher frog populations in South Carolina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG9sLTHaark&t=5s). Before that, I graduated with a B.S. in Biology from the University of South Carolina, Aiken in 2019.

I'm interested in conservation ecology, data science, science communication, invasive species, amphibian ecology, ecotoxicology, and restoration ecology. I work a lot with R and GIS and have no trouble teaching myself new software. My latest pursuits are Quarto and LaTeX for writing protocols, manuscripts, and storing code.

Outside of work, I enjoy going for walks with my wife, spending time with my daughter, herping, camping, playing adult-league soccer, and board games with friends.
